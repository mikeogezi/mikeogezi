- Hello 👋, I'm Michael. 
- I'm a Master's student at the [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/computing-science/index.html) doing research at the intersection of [Natural Language Processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing) and [Vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision).
- I am grateful to be supervised by [Greg Kondrak](http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~kondrak/).
- Specifically, I'm interested in grounding language within the visually perceived world. I'm also interested in getting robots to understand open-ended natural language commands.
- To a lesser extent, I'm interested in Quantum Computing ⚛️ and Astronomy 🌌.
- I was previously a Software Engineer at [Helicarrier](https://helicarrierstudio.com/), where I did some especially cool work, and [TeamApt](https://teamapt.com/).
