- Hello 👋, I'm Mike.
- I'm working on a startup
- I was a Master's student at the [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/computing-science/index.html) doing AI research ∈ ([Natural Language Processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing) ∩ [Computer Vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision)).
- I worked on grounding language within the visual world with neural models that generate meaningful & useful concept representations from images and text. Future-wise, I look to build systems that holistically understand the world and lead to [transformative AI](https://www.cold-takes.com/transformative-ai-timelines-part-1-of-4-what-kind-of-ai/).
- I am grateful to have been supervised by [Greg Kondrak](http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~kondrak/).
- I'm also interested in Quantum Computing ⚛️ and Astronomy 🌌.
- I was previously a Software Engineer at [Helicarrier](https://helicarrierstudio.com/), where I did some especially [cool work](http://help.buycoins.africa/article/k0r0ayjfh7-order-books-explained), and [TeamApt](https://teamapt.com/).
